The project is divided into two parts:
    The first part is a book management system that allows users to search for books by title or ISBN and reset the number of copies available. To run this part of the project, you can use the following commands:
        g++ main.cpp bookType.cp
        ./a.out
    The second part of the project is a test file designed to test the bookType class in stack, queue, and vector. To run this part of the project, you can use the following commands:
        g++ bookTypeTest.cpp bookType.cp
        ./a.out
